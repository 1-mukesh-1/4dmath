Thinking about 4 spatial-dimensional geometry is fun, but it's very hard to develop an intuition for at first. We developed this web-based viewer as a hackathon project @hackulus. Its original purpose was to teach an Introduction to 4D Geometry class for non-math majors.

In this project, we are planning to develop a web application that can visualize complex mathematical functions.

Features of the project:
* We can set the shape properties by providing the function
* 2d,3d, and 4d functions are supported
* We can change the resolution of graphics
* For sample visualizations, some inbuilt complex functions like hypersphere and hypertube are provided
* Camera perspective can be changed by the user
* Different coordinate axes like cartesian, Cylindrical, Convex-hull are supported by this application
* Responsive Site

So the basic target of this project is to understand the behavior of some complex functions by better visualizations.
